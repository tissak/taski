# Taski — Engineering Context & Onboarding

*Onboarding guide for new engineers. Last updated: 2026-06-24 (post-v0.4 — adds Tier 1 metadata parsing [tags, priority, start/created/done/cancelled dates], Tier 2 views [overdue `O`, group-by cycling `G`], the `✅` done-date stamp on toggle [ADR-0012], the `❌` cancelled-date stamp on cancel [ADR-0013], the `➕` quick-add inbox creation [ADR-0014], the `o` open-in-Obsidian deep-link gesture [ADR-0015], the `i` in-progress toggle gesture [ADR-0016], and the `taski-skip` frontmatter opt-out [ADR-0017]; user-configurable TUI theming + per-panel density knobs [ADR-0018], followed by a global `bold` style toggle [off by default — color contrast carries emphasis] and a finer note-grouping split [`folder+note` / `note` / `folder`], and the `n` add-note task-annotation gesture [grouped `## task-notes` section + aliased in-page link, ADR-0019], and the `m` move-mode task-reordering gesture [TUI-local reorder committed as one in-note line-content permutation, ADR-0020]; 421 tests across 6 crates).*

This document is the "operating manual" for working on Taski: what it is, how it's
built, the decisions that are load-bearing (and must not be casually undone), and the
landmines that will bite you if you don't know they're there. Read this first, then the
[`PRD`](./PRD.md), [`tech.md`](./tech.md), and the [ADRs](./adr/).

## TL;DR

**Taski** is a personal, single-user partner app for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It
continuously scans one Markdown vault, extracts every checkbox task (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`,
`- [/]`) into a structured SQLite index, and shows them in a terminal UI where you can
browse, filter, and toggle them — with toggles written safely back into the notes.
Obsidian stays the source of truth; Taski is the fast "execution layer" over scattered
tasks.

A unified Rust binary (`taski` — daemon + TUI in one process) backed by a shared SQLite file (the standalone `taski-daemon` / `taski-tui` binaries are kept for backcompat):

```
 Obsidian vault ──watch──▶ taski-daemon ──write──▶ SQLite (taski.db) ◀──read─── taski-tui
   (source of       (sole writer to vault            tasks + pending_actions        (polls)
    truth)           + to the index)
                          ▲                                  │ inserts action rows
                          └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

The whole point of the architecture: **SQLite is the decoupling boundary.** The daemon
writes; the TUI reads; write-back commands flow back through a `pending_actions` table
that only the daemon executes. By default `taski` runs both roles together in one process
(the diagram's two boxes are the standalone binaries, still kept for backcompat); neither
side talks to the other directly.

## Repository Layout

Cargo workspace, edition 2024, six crates. Dependencies point downward only (no cycles):

| Crate | Responsibility | Key file(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `taski-core` | **Pure** domain: `Task`/`Status`/`Priority` types, the Markdown parser (`parse_tasks`, fence-aware), emoji extraction (`extract_due_date` 📅/📆/🗓, `extract_scheduled_date` ⏳, `extract_start_date` 🛫, `extract_created_date` ➕, `extract_done_date` ✅, `extract_cancelled_date` ❌ — all via shared `extract_emoji_date`; plus `extract_priority` 🔺/⏫/🔼/🔽/⏬ and `extract_tags` `#tag`), the pure `rewrite_scheduled` line-rewrite oracle (ADR-0009 Phase 2), `inbox_line_for` construction oracle (ADR-0014), the task-note oracles `insert_notes_link`/`notes_link_id`/`note_bullet_for` (ADR-0019), the pure `permute_lines` reorder oracle (ADR-0020), and pure `ymd_from_unix` (today's date, no date crate). No FS, no I/O, no deps on other taski crates. | `crates/taski-core/src/lib.rs` |
| `taski-config` | TOML config loading (`~/.config/taski/config.toml`) + CLI→config→default precedence + the `template()` renderer for `--init-config`. Fields include `exclude_dirs` for skipping vault subdirectory trees, `inbox_path` for the quick-add target note (ADR-0014), and `obsidian_vault`/`use_advanced_uri` for the open-in-Obsidian deep link (ADR-0015), and `ThemeConfig`/`UiConfig` for TUI theming and per-panel density (ADR-0018). Keeps FS/TOML out of `taski-core`. | `crates/taski-config/src/lib.rs` |
| `taski-db` | The canonical SQLite schema, `open()` (WAL + schema + dir creation), and all read/write APIs (`all_tasks`, `reconcile_note`, `enqueue_action` / `enqueue_set_scheduled` / `enqueue_bullet_toggle`, `pending_actions`, `prune_old_actions`, `delete_tasks_for_excluded_dirs`, …). Owns `tasks` + `pending_actions` + `note_contents`. | `crates/taski-db/src/lib.rs` |
| `taski-daemon` | The watcher/scanner + **sole writer to the vault**: the reusable engine `run_daemon(opts, shutdown, lock)`, plus `scan_vault`, `index_note`, `process_action` (checkbox flips) / `process_metadata_action` (`⏳` writes) / `process_bullet_action` (checkbox↔bullet toggle) / `process_quick_add` (inbox append, ADR-0014) / `process_add_note` (task-note append + first-note link insertion, ADR-0019) / `process_reorder` (in-note line-content permutation, ADR-0020) — all reuse `atomic_write` (ADR-0009/0011/0019/0020), the watch loop; the `ShutdownSignal`/`ShutdownHandle` pair; and the `flock` single-writer lock (`DaemonLockGuard`/`acquire_daemon_lock`/`LockOutcome`). The drain loop dispatches on `pending_actions.action_type`. Also handles `exclude_dirs` purge + filtered scanning. **lib + bin** — a `taski-daemon` binary *and* the library the unified launcher depends on. | `crates/taski-daemon/src/{lib,main,shutdown,lock}.rs`, `tests/` |
| `taski-tui` | The `ratatui` client: polls the index, groups by folder+note/note/tag/priority/folder (`G` cycling), filters (status-cycle `f`, Today view `T`, Overdue `O`, text search `/`, file search `F`), renders, submits toggle (`Space`) / mark-for-today (`t`) / bullet toggle (`b`) / quick-add (`a`) / add-note (`n`, ADR-0019) / reorder (`m` move mode, ADR-0020) / undo (`u`) actions, shows the context pane via the cached `note_contents` table, and opens the selected task's note in Obsidian via an `obsidian://` deep link (`o`, ADR-0015 — the TUI's first `std::process::Command` spawn). Never touches vault files. **lib + bin** — public entry points `run()` / `run_with_db(db)` / `run_combined(db, quit_hook)`; `main.rs` is a thin shim. Key internal modules: `App` (state machine), `build_view` (filter pipeline + HashMap grouping), `draw` (render), `run_loop` (input), `theme.rs` for the `Theme` + `LayoutPrefs` types resolved from config (ADR-0018). | `crates/taski-tui/src/{lib,main}.rs` |
| `taski` | The **unified launcher** binary: runs the daemon (background thread) + TUI (main thread) together by default (`taski`), or either alone via `taski daemon` / `taski tui` subcommands. Attach-or-spawn + single-writer lock (ADRs 0007/0008). | `crates/taski/src/main.rs` |

Supporting: `docs/` (PRD, tech, ADRs, setup, code reviews under `docs/cr/`, this file), `scripts/install-launchd.sh`
+ `uninstall-launchd.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`.

---

## Build, Run, Test

```sh
cargo build --workspace                       # dev build
cargo build --release --workspace             # optimized daily-driver binaries
cargo test --workspace                        # all tests (~390, post-v0.4)
cargo test -p taski-daemon writeback          # run one suite / filter by name
```

The CI gates (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, macOS) are exactly three steps:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all
```

(`--all` is cargo's alias for `--workspace`.) There is **no** `cargo-deny`/supply-chain
step in CI — install and run it locally if you want it. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins
**stable**, which auto-installs on first `cargo` invocation.

**Run it** (daily driver): see [`setup.md`](./setup.md). Short version:

```sh
./target/release/taski                                                    # combined: daemon + TUI, drains on quit
./target/release/taski daemon                                             # daemon only (what launchd runs)
./target/release/taski tui                                                # TUI only (reader)
./target/release/taski-daemon --init-config --vault /path/to/your/vault   # one-time config
./target/release/taski-daemon --once --vault /path/to/vault               # single scan + exit (no watcher)
# or autostart the daemon at login:
scripts/install-launchd.sh
```

Config precedence is **CLI flag → config file → compiled default**. `vault` has no
default (daemon requires it); `db` defaults to `./taski.db`. Config location is
`~/.config/taski/config.toml`, overridable with the `TASKI_CONFIG` env var.

### Debugging

- **Logs:** the daemon logs via `tracing` at `info` by default. Where they go depends on
  the entry point: `taski daemon` and standalone `taski-daemon` log to **stderr** (so
  under launchd they stream to `~/.local/share/taski/daemon.log`); `taski` in **combined
  mode** routes the daemon thread's tracing to that log **file** directly (never stderr —
  stderr would garble the TUI's alternate screen). Set `RUST_LOG=debug` (or
  `taski_daemon=trace`) to see reconciliation summaries, action outcomes, and conflict
  reasons.
- **Inspect the index/queue directly:**
  `sqlite3 ~/.local/share/taski/taski.db "SELECT id,note_path,state,error FROM pending_actions ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10"`
  — the fastest way to answer "why didn't my toggle land?" (`state` is `pending`/`done`/`failed`).
- **Shutdown:** `taski daemon` / standalone `taski-daemon` install a ctrlc handler — the
  **first** Ctrl-C initiates a clean shutdown (up to ~500ms, the event-loop tick); a
  **second** Ctrl-C force-terminates. In **combined mode** there is no ctrlc handler — the
  TUI runs in raw mode (which swallows `SIGINT`) and `q`/`Esc`/Ctrl-C all drive the same
  shutdown path; the daemon then drains and the process exits. A brief pause after quit is
  the drain, not a hang.
- **Latency expectations:** FS events are debounced **300ms**; the daemon event loop ticks
  every **500ms**; the TUI re-reads the index every **750ms**. So a toggle or an Obsidian
  edit typically reflects in 1–2s.

---

## The Mental Model: Two Data Flows + TUI Filtering

Understanding these two flows is 90% of understanding the codebase.

### 1. Indexing (vault → index), daemon-owned

```
FS event (debounced 300ms) ─▶ scan_vault / index_note(note)
                              └─▶ taski_core::parse_tasks(note_text)   // fence-aware; extracts 8 Obsidian-Tasks tokens (📅/📆/🗓 due, ⏳ scheduled, 🛫 start, ➕ created, ✅ done, ❌ cancelled, #tags, priority 🔺/⏫/🔼/🔽/⏬)
                                  └─▶ taski_db::reconcile_note(...)    // ADR-0005 (see below)
```

`reconcile_note` matches the freshly-parsed tasks against existing rows for that note by
`text_hash` (content-hash). Matches **keep their surrogate `id`** (UPDATE in place); the
rest are deleted/inserted. This is how a task keeps its identity when text *above* it
shifts its `line_number`.

### 2. Write-back (TUI → vault), via the daemon as sole writer

```
TUI: user hits Space on a task
 └─▶ taski_db::enqueue_action(task_id, expected_char, new_char, ...)   // inserts a 'pending' row
       (daemon, next tick)
       └─▶ process_action: SELECT the task row for its CURRENT line_number (not the stale action line)
           ├─▶ check: current note content-hash == stored note_hash?  else → ConflictNoteChanged (refuse)
           ├─▶ ADR-0012: if flip → Done, compose ✅ <today> stamp into the same line bytes
           │              (rewrite_done_date oracle; if → Open, clear ✅; malformed ✅ → refuse)
           └─▶ atomic_write(note, expected_hash, new_bytes)   // ONE write: flip + stamp together
                 ├─ re-read file bytes, re-hash, compare to expected_hash   // TOCTOU guard (2nd check)
                 ├─ if mismatch → WriteResult::Conflict (refuse; mark action 'failed')   // never clobber
                 └─ else → write temp (.taski.tmp) → fsync → rename over the note
            └─▶ on success: flip + stamp landed, re-index the note, mark action 'done'
```

**ADR-0012 composes `✅` done-date stamping into this same flow** (no new action type).
When the flip transitions to Done (`[ ]`→`[x]`), `process_action_at` also stamps `✅ <today>`
into the same byte buffer before the single `atomic_write`. When transitioning back to Open
(`[x]`→`[ ]`), any existing `✅` is removed. Flips to/from InProgress (`/`) leave `✅` alone.
A malformed `✅` refuses the whole action (`DoneDateUnparseable`). The pure
`rewrite_done_date` oracle shares a generalized `rewrite_emoji_date` core with
`rewrite_scheduled` (ADR-0009).

**The same pipeline carries the second action type (`set_scheduled` / `⏳` mark-for-today, ADR-0009 Phase 2).** The TUI enqueues a `pending_actions` row with `action_type='set_scheduled'` and `payload=<date>` (or `NULL` to unmark); the daemon dispatches on `action_type` and runs a structurally parallel `process_metadata_action` instead of `process_action`:

```
TUI: user hits t on a task
 └─▶ taski_db::enqueue_set_scheduled(task_id, line_number, desired_date_or_none)
        (daemon, next tick)
        └─▶ process_metadata_action: same CURRENT line_number + same content-hash check
            ├─▶ call pure taski_core::rewrite_scheduled(line, desired)
            │      → Unchanged (idempotent) → Applied, no write
            │      → Unparseable → MetadataUnparseable, refuse
            │      → Rewritten(new_line) → splice ONLY the target line bytes
            └─▶ same atomic_write(note, expected_hash, new_bytes)   // UNCHANGED: whole-file TOCTOU
                 └─▶ on success: re-index the note, mark action 'done'
```

`atomic_write` and its TOCTOU guard are reused **verbatim** — the whole-file re-hash is
byte-count-agnostic, so whether the mutation was a single-char flip or a variable-length
`⏳` insertion, the same conflict check protects the vault. The pure `rewrite_scheduled`
oracle is testable without any I/O and is guarded by its own 256-case proptest.

The TUI **never** opens a vault file. It only inserts `pending_actions` rows. Only the
daemon mutates notes, and only after byte-re-verification. This is the core safety
guarantee (ADRs 0002/0003/0004/0009).

### 3. Process topology — the unified `taski` binary (ADRs 0007/0008)

By default `taski` runs **both roles in one process**: the daemon on a background thread,
the TUI on the main thread, each with its own SQLite `Connection` (WAL's
one-writer/many-readers is per-*database*, not per-process — so this is identical to the
two-process case). They share a `ShutdownSignal` (`Arc<AtomicBool>`): on TUI quit
(`q`/`Esc`/`Ctrl-C`) the TUI sets it, restores the terminal, and the launcher `join`s the
daemon thread — which first **drains `pending_actions`**, then exits (so a toggle done
right before `q` lands in this session). A `flock` on `<db_dir>/daemon.lock` guarantees a
**sole writer**: if the lock is already held (e.g. launchd's daemon is running), `taski`
**attaches** — runs the TUI-only against that daemon (a reader) instead of spawning a
second daemon. `taski daemon` and `taski-tui` run either side standalone. The daemon
thread is wrapped in `catch_unwind` so a panic/error sets the shutdown signal and logs
rather than corrupting the TUI mid-session.

### 4. TUI Filter Composition + Grouping (five filter axes, one grouping axis)

The TUI's `build_view()` ANDs five independent filter axes in a single pass over the task
list, then buckets the survivors under group headers. Filters narrow each other — adding a
filter can only reduce the visible set:

| Axis | Gesture | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Status cycle | `f` | `All` → `Open` → `Done` → `All`. `Open` = active (not-done) tasks — both `Open` and `InProgress` show alongside each other and count toward the open/total counts (ADR-0016 follow-on); `Done`/other states appear only under `All` |
| Today view | `T` | Tasks whose `scheduled_date == today` |
| Overdue view | `O` | Tasks whose `due_date` is set and `< today` (purely date-based; composes with status — `O`+Open = open past-due, `O`+Done = completed-was-overdue) |
| Text search | `/` | Case-insensitive substring of `task.text` |
| File search | `F` | Case-insensitive substring of `task.note_path` |

Separately, a **grouping axis** (`G`) reorganizes the list's group buckets: folder+note
(default) → note → tag → priority → folder → folder+note. **folder+note** keys on the full
note path; **note** keys on the filename alone (same-named notes in different folders merge);
**folder** keys on the parent directory. Tag grouping **fans out** — a task with N tags appears
under all N tag groups. Groups sort alphabetically (folder+note/note/tag/folder) or by importance
rank (priority, so Medium doesn't sort between Low and Lowest). The grouping axis is orthogonal
to the filters: filters narrow *which* tasks show; grouping controls *how* the survivors
are bucketed.

Both search prompts are modal (Vim `/` style): keystrokes build the query until
dismissed. `Enter` keeps the filter applied; `Esc` clears it. Only one search prompt is
active at a time (whichever key was pressed last), but both filters remain applied
independently — so you can `/deploy` for text, dismiss with `Enter`, then `F alpha` for
file, and the view shows only tasks whose body contains "deploy" **and** whose note path
contains "alpha".

The `build_view` function signature captures all five filter axes plus the grouping axis
(it carries a documented `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` — a parameter-struct
refactor is deferred):
```rust
fn build_view(
    tasks: &[Task],
    filter: StatusFilter,        // All / Open / Done
    expanded: &HashSet<String>,  // group collapse state (keyed by group_key)
    today_only: bool,
    today: &str,                 // today's date string
    search_query: &str,          // text search
    file_query: &str,            // file/path search
    overdue_only: bool,          // O — due_date < today
    group_by: GroupBy,           // G — FolderNote / Note / Tag / Priority / Folder
) -> Vec<DisplayRow>
```

Internally `build_view` no longer walks contiguous `note_path` runs — it HashMap-buckets
tasks by the active axis (handling tag fan-out), orders the buckets, then applies the
filter predicates within each bucket and emits `Header` + `Task` rows.

## TUI Keybinding Reference

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` or `↑` / `↓` | Move selection up/down |
| `Space` | Toggle selected task open ↔ done |
| `Enter` | Toggle group expand/collapse on header |
| `←` / `→` | Collapse / expand group at cursor |
| `Tab` / `⇧Tab` | Expand all / collapse all groups |
| `f` | Cycle status filter: All → Open → Done → All (`Open` shows active/not-done tasks — both `Open` and `InProgress`) |
| `T` | Toggle Today view (tasks scheduled for today) |
| `O` | Toggle Overdue view (tasks whose `due_date < today`) |
| `G` | Cycle grouping axis: folder+note → note → tag → priority → folder → folder+note |
| `t` | Mark/unmark selected task for today (writes `⏳ <today>`) |
| `b` | Toggle selected task between checkbox (`- [ ]`) and bullet (`-`) format |
| `d` | Cancel selected task (`- [ ]` → `- [-]`, stamps `❌ <today>`; press again to un-cancel) [ADR-0013] |
| `i` | Mark selected task in-progress (`- [ ]` → `- [/]`; press again to re-open). Leaves any existing `✅`/`❌` stamp untouched [ADR-0016] |
| `a` | Quick-add: open text-entry modal; type task text, Enter appends `- [ ] <text> ➕ <today>` to the inbox note (`u` to undo) [ADR-0014] |
| `n` | Add note: open text-entry modal; type a closing note, Enter appends it as a bullet under the task's `### notes-<id>` heading in a `## task-notes` section in the task's own note, and (first note only) inserts an aliased in-page link `[[#notes-<id>\|Notes]]` into the task line. No undo [ADR-0019] |
| `m` | Move mode: enter on the selected task (flat single-note groups only), then `j`/`k`/`↑`/`↓` bubble it within its note; `Enter` commits the new order as one `reorder` write, `Esc` restores the original order. TUI-local until commit; index refresh suspended while moving. No undo in v1 [ADR-0020] |
| `u` | Undo the last checkbox flip (incl. cancel), bullet toggle, or quick-add action |
| `/` | Open text search prompt (matches `task.text`, case-insensitive) |
| `F` | Open file/path search prompt (matches `task.note_path`) |
| `o` | Open the selected task's note in Obsidian via an `obsidian://` deep link (native: opens the file; with `use_advanced_uri = true`: jumps to the task's line — requires the Advanced URI plugin). Read-only, TUI-local; macOS only [ADR-0015] |
| `p` | Toggle the context pane (right-half note preview) |
| `J` / `K` | Scroll context pane up/down |
| `?` | Toggle the floating keybindings help overlay (modal: `?`/`Esc`/`q` close it without quitting; `Ctrl-C` still quits from any state). The footer cheat-sheet is trimmed to essentials; the full list lives here |
| `q` / `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` | Quit |

While a search prompt is active: `Esc` cancels (clears filter), `Enter` dismisses (keeps
filter), `Backspace` edits query, characters build query.

The footer cheat-sheet is trimmed to the most-used gestures (`j/k move · Space toggle ·
Enter fold · f filter · / search · ? help · q quit`); the full keybinding list lives in the
floating help overlay opened by `?`. The overlay is modal — it intercepts keys before
normal dispatch, so `?`/`Esc`/`q` close it (without quitting) and every other key is
swallowed until dismissed; `Ctrl-C` remains the always-available emergency exit.

## Data Model (schema v7)

Defined in `taski-db::SCHEMA`. `PRAGMA user_version` tracks the version; older DBs are
dropped and recreated (pre-MVP, no data to preserve). v3 added the `note_contents` cache
that backs the read-only TUI context pane ([ADR-0006](./adr/0006-note-content-cached-in-index.md));
v4 added `tasks.scheduled_date` (`⏳`) backing the "Today" view
([ADR-0009](./adr/0009-scheduled-date-today.md), Phase 1); v5 added
`pending_actions.action_type` + `payload` for the `⏳` write gesture (ADR-0009, Phase 2);
v6 added six read-only metadata columns to `tasks` (Tier 1: `tags`, `priority`,
`start_date`, `created_date`, `done_date`, `cancelled_date`); **v7 added `tasks.indent`** —
the leading-whitespace column of the source line, capturing subtask nesting depth for
visual indentation in the TUI. Each bump is destructive — existing dev DBs are
dropped+recreated and the index rebuilds from the vault.

**`tasks`** — one row per checkbox task found in the vault:

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` — **surrogate identity**, never reused (ADR-0005). NOT path+line. |
| `note_path`, `line_number` | **Write-time location only**, re-verified against file bytes before any mutation. Not trusted as identity. |
| `indent` *(v7)* | Leading-whitespace column of the source line (spaces 1:1, tabs expanded to 4-column tab stops). Captures subtask nesting depth for visual indentation in the TUI. Zero for top-level tasks. Read-only (parsed, not written). |
| `text`, `text_hash` | Body + its hash; `text_hash` drives reconciliation and the write-back TOCTOU check. |
| `status` | `open` / `done` / `in_progress` (+ other Obsidian chars). Reconstructed from `raw_checkbox_char` on read (`all_tasks`); the stored column is never consulted, so the two can't drift. |
| `raw_checkbox_char` | The exact checkbox char seen at scan; re-verified before flipping. |
| `note_hash` | Content hash of the note at last scan — **the** conflict-detection input (re-checked before write-back). |
| `note_mtime` | Note mtime at last scan — **informational only**, not used by conflict detection. |
| `due_date` | Parsed 📅/📆/🗓 date (Obsidian Tasks-plugin syntax). |
| `scheduled_date` *(v4)* | Parsed `⏳` scheduled date (Obsidian Tasks-plugin syntax — "plan to work on this"). Backs the Today view (`T`) and is *written* by the `t` "mark for today" gesture ([ADR-0009](./adr/0009-scheduled-date-today.md)). |
| `tags` *(v6)* | Parsed `#tag`s — multi-value, stored as a space-separated sentinel TEXT (`" foo bar "`) for cheap Tier 2 whole-tag SQL matching; `Vec<String>` on `Task`. The codebase's first multi-value field; no `serde_json` dep. |
| `priority` *(v6)* | Parsed priority emoji → `Priority` enum (`Highest` `🔺` / `High` `⏫` / `Medium` `🔼` / `Low` `🔽` / `Lowest` `⏬` / `Other`). Stored as the canonical emoji char. Note `⏫` is **High**, not Highest (the common mix-up). |
| `start_date` *(v6)* | Parsed `🛫` start date (Obsidian Tasks syntax). |
| `created_date` *(v6)* | Parsed `➕` created date. |
| `done_date` *(v6)* | Parsed `✅` done date. **Stamped on toggle** by `process_action` (ADR-0012): `[ ]`→`[x]` stamps `✅ <today>`, `[x]`→`[ ]` clears it. |
| `cancelled_date` *(v6)* | Parsed `❌` cancelled date. **Stamped on cancel** by `process_action` (ADR-0013): `[ ]`→`[-]` stamps `❌ <today>`, `[-]`→`[ ]` clears it; cross-state flips clear the other stamp (done↔cancelled). |
| `updated_at` | Last-seen timestamp. |

**`pending_actions`** — the TUI→daemon command queue. Lifecycle `pending → done | failed`.
Each row carries `task_id`, an `action_type` (`checkbox`, `set_scheduled`, `toggle_bullet`,
`undo`, `quick_add`, `quick_add_undo`, `add_note`, or `reorder`), and a `payload` (NULL for checkbox flips; the desired
date / NULL-to-unmark for `set_scheduled`; the prior checkbox char for undo; the task text for
`quick_add`/`quick_add_undo` (with `note_path` = inbox path, `task_id` = 0 sentinel); the note text for
`add_note` (ADR-0019; `task_id`/`note_path`/`line_number` identify the annotated task); and a comma-separated
list of the involved task lines' 1-based line numbers in their new top-to-bottom order for `reorder` (ADR-0020;
`task_id` = the moved anchor task, `note_path` = the note)). Checkbox rows
also hold `expected_char`/`new_char`; date-action rows leave them empty and the daemon dispatches
on `action_type`. On failure an `error` is recorded. Resolved rows older than 7 days are pruned
on daemon startup (`ACTION_RETENTION_SECS`).

**`note_contents`** *(v3)* — per-note full-text cache backing the read-only TUI context
pane ([ADR-0006](./adr/0006-note-content-cached-in-index.md)). One row per indexed note:
`note_path` (PK), `content` (full UTF-8 text), `note_hash` (mirrors the note's
`tasks.note_hash`), `updated_at` (informational). The daemon writes it in the same
`index_note` pass that parses tasks, so content, hash, and task `line_number` all derive
from one byte snapshot. The TUI reads it via `db::note_content()` — it still never opens a
vault file. Window sizing is a render concern and lives in the TUI, not the index.

## Key Design Decisions (read the ADRs — these are load-bearing)

Each of these exists for a concrete reason. **Do not undo one without reading its ADR and
understanding the failure mode it prevents.**

1. **rusqlite + WAL, not Limbo/Turso** ([ADR-0001](./adr/0001-rusqlite-not-limbo.md)) —
   Limbo had no multi-process WAL access (hard blocker for a separate TUI process). Don't
   "modernize" to Limbo without confirming `multiprocess_wal` is stable *and* drops the
   no-mixing rule.

2. **Write-back routes through the daemon** ([ADR-0002](./adr/0002-write-back-through-daemon.md))
   — the daemon is the *sole* writer to the vault, draining `pending_actions`. The TUI
   must never write a note directly. This is what makes write-back auditable and safe.

3. **Checkbox-state flips only** ([ADR-0003](./adr/0003-checkbox-only-mvp.md), **amended by [ADR-0009](./adr/0009-scheduled-date-today.md) and [ADR-0012](./adr/0012-done-date-on-toggle.md)**)
   — MVP write-back flips `[ ]↔[x]`, nothing more. Text/metadata edits are explicitly deferred.
   Adding "edit task text from the TUI" is a *big* change, not a small one. ADR-0009 widens
   the scope to **also** permit Obsidian-standard date-emoji metadata (`⏳` scheduled) for the
   "mark for today" gesture. ADR-0012 composes `✅` done-date stamping into the checkbox flip
   itself (`[ ]`→`[x]` stamps `✅ <today>`, `[x]`→`[ ]` clears it) — no new action type, no
   new gesture. Both amendments admit tokens under the unchanged grammar-provability gate:
   standard syntax + single insertion grammar + pure proptested oracle. Free-text edits and
   creates/deletes remain rejected (arbitrary-note creation and mid-note insertion remain rejected; bounded append-only creation to a designated inbox was admitted by ADR-0014).

4. **Refuse-on-conflict, never last-write-wins** ([ADR-0004](./adr/0004-refuse-on-conflict.md))
   — before renaming, re-read the note and re-hash; if it changed since scan, *refuse*
   (mark the action `failed`), do not overwrite. The addendum hardens the temp→rename
   step against TOCTOU. If you ever feel tempted to "just write it," don't.

5. **Surrogate rowid identity + content-hash reconciliation** ([ADR-0005](./adr/0005-surrogate-identity.md))
   — `id` is an autoincrement integer (stable, never reused), decoupled from location.
   `(note_path, line_number)` is a write-time location claim, re-verified against bytes.
   Crucially: **Taski injects nothing into the vault** (unlike Logseq-style inline IDs);
   identity is reconciled from content each scan. This was validated against
   Obsidian-Tasks prior art. (Note: ADR-0009's `⏳` write is *native Obsidian Tasks syntax* —
   human-readable and consumed by Tasks/Dataview — not the foreign opaque identity marker
   this ADR rejected, so ADR-0005 is **not** amended by it.)

6. **Note content cached in the index for the TUI context pane** ([ADR-0006](./adr/0006-note-content-cached-in-index.md))
   — the daemon caches each note's full text in `note_contents`; the TUI reads it like any
   other index data. The TUI **still never opens a vault file** — this is a read path, not
   a relaxation of ADR-0002. Chosen over "TUI reads the vault directly" so content and task
   locations stay consistent (same scan) and the SQLite decoupling boundary stays intact.

7. **Unified launcher + single-writer lock** ([ADR-0007](./adr/0007-unified-in-process-launcher.md), [ADR-0008](./adr/0008-single-writer-file-lock.md)) — one `taski` binary runs daemon + TUI in-process; a `flock` on `<db_dir>/daemon.lock` guarantees a sole writer across all startup combinations (launchd + `taski`, etc.), closing the two-daemon corruption vector ADR-0004 doesn't cover.

8. **Scheduled date `⏳` + Today view** ([ADR-0009](./adr/0009-scheduled-date-today.md)) —
   Taski parses Obsidian's `⏳` scheduled date and writes `⏳ today` as the "mark for today"
   triage gesture. Phase 1 (parser + schema v4 + read-only `T` Today view) and Phase 2 (the
   `t` toggle write gesture, schema v5 `pending_actions.action_type`/`payload`, the pure
   `taski_core::rewrite_scheduled` line-rewrite + daemon `process_metadata_action` reusing
   `atomic_write` unchanged) are both shipped. This is Taski's **first non-checkbox vault
   write**; it amends ADR-0003 (write-back scope) but not ADR-0005. The view is strict
   `scheduled_date == today`, orthogonal to the `f` status-cycle. "Today" is computed by the
   pure `taski_core::ymd_from_unix` (no date crate). Two 256-case proptests guard the write.

9. **Text and file search in the TUI** ([ADR-0010](./adr/0010-text-search.md)) —
   Two independent modal search gestures: `/` for case-insensitive substring of
   `task.text`, `F` for case-insensitive substring of `task.note_path`. Both AND with
   each other and with the status/Today filters. Only one search prompt active at a time
   (whichever key was pressed last), but both filters stay applied independently.
   Initially implemented as a single unified search (text + path together), then split
   into two gestures because a path match can accidentally broaden a text search.

10. **Bullet toggle and undo** ([ADR-0011](./adr/0011-bullet-toggle-undo.md)) —
   Two new action types: `toggle_bullet` (`b` key, toggles `- [ ] task` ↔ `- task`) and
   `undo` (`u` key, reverses the last checkbox or bullet action). Both route through the
   daemon's existing `process_action` pipeline (same `lookup_task_for_action` +
   content-hash + `atomic_write`). No schema change — `pending_actions.action_type` is
   already a TEXT column. Undo queues the reverse action immediately without waiting for
   the original to resolve; if the original failed, the undo fails naturally because the
   daemon re-verifies current state. `t` (mark-for-today) is not undo-able — it's
   already idempotent (pressing `t` again removes the mark).

11. **`exclude_dirs` config for vault directory exclusion** — The `exclude_dirs` field
    in `config.toml` skips whole subdirectory trees (e.g. `_System/Templates`) from vault
    scanning and indexing. Works alongside the always-excluded hidden dirs (`.obsidian`,
    `.trash`, `.git`). On daemon startup, stale entries matching excluded prefixes are
    purged from both `tasks` and `note_contents`. Watcher events inside excluded dirs are
    also dropped. Exclude paths are relative to the vault root.

12. **Done-date `✅` stamp on toggle** ([ADR-0012](./adr/0012-done-date-on-toggle.md)) —
    Closes the interop gap where tasks toggled done via Taski were invisible to Tasks-plugin
    "done" queries. The `✅ <today>` stamp is **composed into the same byte buffer** as the
    checkbox flip in `process_action_at` — one write, one hash, one rename. On `[ ]`→`[x]`
    the stamp is appended (or its date replaced if a `✅` already exists); on `[x]`→`[ ]` the
    `✅` is removed (symmetry). Flips to/from in-progress (`/`) leave `✅` untouched (ambiguous).
    A malformed existing `✅` refuses the whole action (`DoneDateUnparseable` — no flip, no
    stamp). The pure `rewrite_done_date` oracle is a sibling of `rewrite_scheduled`, sharing
    a generalized `rewrite_emoji_date` core; both backed by 256-case proptests. No new action
    type, schema change, or TUI key — `Space` already enqueues the flip.

13. **`❌` cancelled-date stamp on cancel** ([ADR-0013](./adr/0013-cancelled-date-on-cancel.md)) —
    The `d` key flips `[ ]`→`[-]` (Obsidian cancelled state) and composes a `❌ <today>` stamp
    into the same byte buffer as the flip, exactly parallel to ADR-0012's `✅` on `[ ]`→`[x]`.
    Cross-state flips clear the other stamp (done→cancelled clears `✅`; cancelled→done clears
    `❌`; either→open clears both). No new action_type, no schema change — the cancel gesture
    reuses the `checkbox` action with `new_char='-'`, so `u` undo is **free** (cancel *is* a
    checkbox flip). Amends ADR-0003 a third time under the unchanged ADR-0009 grammar-
    provability gate; `❌` is the third (likely final) dated token admitted. `process_action`'s
    stamp decision widens from ADR-0012's two-state (done/open) model to a three-state
    (done/cancelled/open) model. A hard-delete alternative was considered in depth and
    rejected — it would have been Taski's first structural mutation (line-count change),
    requiring a new "removal-only" boundary ADR, a `restore_task` action type, a schema bump,
    and accepting a restart-data-loss edge; cancel delivers the same UX intent at a fraction
    of the code with strictly better safety properties.

14. **Quick-add — bounded append-only creation to a designated inbox** ([ADR-0014](./adr/0014-quick-add-inbox-creation.md)) —
    The `a` key opens a single-line text-entry modal; Enter appends `- [ ] <text> ➕ <today>` to a configurable inbox note
    (default `task-inbox.md`, `inbox_path` in config; created if missing). This is Taski's **first content-creation feature**,
    opening a **new gate class** — bounded append-only creation — distinct from the grammar-provability token gate of
    ADRs 0009/0012/0013 (which only edit existing lines). The new gate admits append-only writes to a designated inbox
    (no mid-note insertion, no text editing, no deletion); appending shifts no existing lines, so no positional
    reconciliation or `expected_note_hash` is needed. The `➕ <today>` created-date stamp is composed into the appended
    line (same one-write principle as `✅`/`❌`). No schema change — `pending_actions` carries sentinel values
    (`task_id=0`, `line_number=0`, empty strings) for unused columns. First-creation of a non-existent inbox skips the
    TOCTOU re-hash (a bounded ADR-0004 exception — nothing to conflict with). Undo (`u`) removes the appended line
    (first content-removing undo, safe because the line is positionally and contentually known). Amends ADR-0003 a
    fourth time.

15. **Open-in-Obsidian deep-link gesture** ([ADR-0015](./adr/0015-open-in-obsidian-deep-link.md)) —
    The `o` key builds an `obsidian://` URL from the selected task's `note_path` (+ `line_number`) and hands it to
    macOS `open`, focusing Obsidian at the task's source note. This is **Taski's first read-only, TUI-local,
    OS-boundary gesture** — it mutates nothing: no vault write, no daemon round-trip, no `pending_actions` row, no
    index change. It therefore does **not** amend ADR-0002 or any write-back ADR (the TUI still never opens a vault
    file; it composes a URL and calls `open`). URL mode is configurable: native `obsidian://open?vault=&file=` by
    default (zero plugin dependency, opens the file but cannot target a line), or `obsidian://advanced-uri?…&line=`
    when `use_advanced_uri = true` (jumps to the exact line; requires the Advanced URI community plugin). The vault
    name is derived from the configured vault path's basename, overridable via `obsidian_vault` in config. The TUI's
    first `std::process::Command` spawn is fire-and-forget with null stdio (cannot garble the alternate screen); on
    failure it `tracing::warn!`s (in-TUI failure notice deferred). macOS-only (`open`); Linux/Windows (`xdg-open`/`start`)
    deferred — note `xdg-open` additionally needs double-encoding of URL values.

16. **In-progress (`/`) toggle gesture** ([ADR-0016](./adr/0016-in-progress-toggle.md)) —
    The `i` key flips the selected task to the Obsidian in-progress state (`- [ ]` → `- [/]`; press `i` again to
    re-open). It reuses the `checkbox` action_type with `new_char = '/'` — the exact structural mirror of `d`/cancel
    (`new_char = '-'`, ADR-0013) and `Space`/done (`new_char = 'x'`). **No new action_type, no schema change, no new
    `LastAction` variant, no pure oracle, no daemon change, and no ADR-0003 amendment** — in-progress is a checkbox-state
    flip to a char that was always within the admitted scope; this is the first write-gesture ADR that touches only the
    TUI. The daemon already had an explicit "other chars (e.g. InProgress `/`) → skip the `✅`/`❌` stamp oracles; only the
    flip is written" arm (ADR-0012/0013), so a `/` flip leaves any existing `✅`/`❌` stamp untouched (a done task marked
    in-progress keeps its `✅` — accepted as coherent, not a bug). Undo is free (`u` already reverses checkbox flips). No
    new proptest — the existing `writeback_proptest` already exercises arbitrary-`new_char` flips.

17. **Frontmatter `taski-skip` per-note opt-out** ([ADR-0017](./adr/0017-frontmatter-taski-skip-opt-out.md)) —
    A note whose first-line YAML frontmatter carries `taski-skip: true` contributes **no tasks** to the index. The pure
    `taski_core::taski_skip_enabled(markdown)` detector (no new dep) is consulted by a single guard in the daemon's
    `index_note` — the chokepoint both the initial `scan_vault` and the live watcher pass through — so adding/removing
    the flag takes effect on the next scan (~1s). When set, the note is reconciled with an **empty** task list, which
    **evicts** any previously-indexed rows for it (`reconcile_note`'s unmatched-row delete); the `note_contents` cache is
    skipped. This is an **index/read-path** feature: no `pending_actions`, no vault mutation, no schema bump, and no
    write-back ADR is touched (a skipped note has no task rows, so the TUI can never enqueue an action against it). Only
    the literal boolean `true` (case-insensitive) or its quoted `"true"`/`'true'` variants are honored — `false`, `yes`,
    `on`, empty, or a malformed/unclosed frontmatter block are all treated as "not set." The per-file, content-local
complement to `exclude_dirs` (#11, directory-level). Notably `exclude_dirs` lacks its own ADR; ADR-0017 exists because
the frontmatter grammar is a load-bearing contract future parsing must respect.

18. **Color theming and per-panel density knobs** ([ADR-0018](./adr/0018-theming-and-per-panel-density.md)) —
    `[theme]` (12 semantic color roles — 11 fg + a `background` — plus a global `bold` toggle) and
    `[ui]` (list_pane_percent, list_density, context_wrap) sections
    in `config.toml` drive user-configurable colors and per-panel space allocation. Resolved from
    `ThemeConfig`/`UiConfig` in `taski-config` (no ratatui dep) to `Theme`/`LayoutPrefs` in `taski-tui`
    once at startup in `run_inner`. Defaults reproduce today's hardcoded palette, with **two deliberate
    divergences**: Note-group headers dim the directory prefix (`path_prefix` role) so the filename pops
    by color contrast, and the global `bold` toggle defaults **off** (bold renders fuzzy on some fonts;
    every render site routes its bold through `Theme::bold_modifier()`, the one choke point).
    `background` defaults to `Reset` (terminal bg, no paint); set it and `draw` fills the whole surface
    (every span is `.fg`-only, so one base bg block shows through). Bad
    color/percent values fall back per-role with `tracing::warn!` (never garble the alt screen); bad
    `list_density` variant fails at config load before the alt screen. Per-pane font size is impossible
    in terminals (no ECMA-48 escape) — the feature reframes "larger text" as allocation + emphasis +
    wrap + density, exactly matching every comparable TUI. No schema bump, no daemon change, no
    write-back ADR touched. **Follow-on:** the old single `note` grouping axis was split into
    `folder+note` (full path, the default), `note` (filename only — same-named notes across folders
    merge), and the existing `folder` axis, via `group_keys` + the new `filename_of` helper.

19. **Task notes — bounded task annotation** ([ADR-0019](./adr/0019-task-notes-annotation.md)) —
    the `n` key opens a single-line modal that appends a free-text closing note to a task. The daemon's
    `process_add_note` appends the note as a `- <text>` bullet under a per-task `### notes-<id>` heading
    inside a single `## task-notes` section **in the note the task already lives in**, and (first note only)
    inserts one aliased in-page link `[[#notes-<id>|Notes]]` into the task line, before its Tasks metadata.
    Both spans commit in **one** `atomic_write` under the ADR-0004 TOCTOU guard; identity is gated by the
    cached `note_hash` (ADR-0006), so no per-line `expected_char` is needed. The **daemon** — never the TUI —
    decides first-vs-append (by reading the existing link) and mints `<id>` (write-time millis). Opens a
    **second new gate class** (bounded task annotation, parallel to ADR-0014's creation gate); it crosses
    ADR-0014's "arbitrary-note append" and "existing-line text edit" exclusions under a narrower
    justification (deterministic target note; single idempotent link insertion). New pure oracles in
    `taski-core` (`insert_notes_link`, `notes_link_id`, `note_bullet_for` — the last escapes a leading `[`
    so a note can't become a phantom task). New `add_note` action_type (sentinel-column pattern, no schema
    bump). **No undo in v1** (remove a note in Obsidian); `## task-notes` hardcoded. Append is not
    replay-idempotent (a crash between write and resolve can duplicate a note — bounded, matches `quick_add`).

20. **Task reordering — bounded structural reordering** ([ADR-0020](./adr/0020-task-reordering.md)) —
    the `m` key enters a TUI-local **move mode**: `j`/`k` bubble the selected task within its note by
    swapping rows in memory, `Enter` commits the new order as one `reorder` action, `Esc` restores the
    original order (free — nothing is written until commit). The daemon's `process_reorder` applies the
    pure `taski_core::permute_lines` oracle — a **permutation of the note's task-line *contents* among their
    existing positions** (line count and every non-task line invariant) — in one `atomic_write` under the
    ADR-0004 TOCTOU guard, gated by the cached `note_hash` (ADR-0006). Identity follows content via
    `text_hash` reconciliation (ADR-0005, **untouched**). Opens a **third new gate class** (bounded
    structural reordering) and **revokes** the "reordering remain rejected" clause in ADRs 0014/0019; the
    first write that changes a line's *position*. New `reorder` action_type (sentinel/anchor columns, no
    schema bump). **v1 is flat-only** (notes with nested tasks refuse move mode) and **within a single
    note** (the index refresh is suspended while moving so it can't clobber the local reorder). **No undo
    in v1** (re-enter move mode to revert) — though reorder is cleanly invertible. Replay-safe: a crash
    between write and resolve refuses on hash mismatch rather than double-applying.

## Gotchas & Landmines (read this before you change anything)

These are the things that aren't obvious from reading the code and will cost you time.

- **Never run tests against the real vault.** The real vault
  (`/Users/.../Personal-Final`, per `~/.config/taski/config.toml`) is the user's data. All tests use `tempfile` fake vaults
  or `:memory:` DBs. If you point a test or a `cargo run` at the real vault, you risk
  mutating real notes. The daemon's `atomic_write` is safe, but **don't rely on that as
  license to test against real data.**

- **`process_action` targets the row's *current* `line_number`, not the action's.** A
  `pending_action` captures a stale `line_number` at enqueue time. When executing, the
  daemon re-reads the task row to get the *current* line, then re-verifies bytes. If you
  "simplify" this to use `action.line_number` directly, you'll re-introduce a
  wrong-line-corruption bug.

- **`atomic_write` re-verifies bytes before rename (TOCTOU).** The expected-hash check
  happens *after* writing the temp file, immediately before `rename`. Don't move or
  reorder the re-read — it's the guard against concurrent Obsidian edits.

- **The metadata write path (`process_metadata_action`) and the composed stamp in
  `process_action` must handle CRLF lines.** A line ending in `\r\n` has the rewrite oracle
  called with the `\r`*excluded* from the splice range — the `content_end` is computed to
  exclude a trailing `\r` so `\r\n` is preserved outside the changed range. If you compute
  the splice span naively from `line.len()`, the `\r` gets removed on CRLF-terminated notes.
  The `metadata_writeback_proptest` and `done_date_writeback_proptest` catch this — their
  `check_oracle` assertions use `str::lines()` (which strips `\r`) as the independent
  reference to verify the written result still parses to the same date.

- **`db::open()` creates parent directories.** SQLite returns `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` if the
  db's directory doesn't exist, so `open()` `create_dir_all`s the parent first. This is
  why `~/.local/share/taski/taski.db` works on first run. (A bare filename or `:memory:`
  has no parent and is left alone.) `open()` returns `anyhow::Result`.

- **Schema migration is destructive.** `ensure_schema` drops+recreates tables on a
  version bump (fine pre-MVP, no data to keep). If you change the schema, bump
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` and know that existing dev DBs get wiped. A real migration path is
  deferred.

- **`rusqlite` is pinned to `0.39`** — `0.40` pulls a `libsqlite3-sys` whose build script
  uses unstable `cfg_select!` and won't compile on stable 1.93. Don't bump it blindly;
  see the pin note in [`tech.md`](./tech.md).

- **Edition 2024 made env mutation `unsafe`.** `std::env::set_var`/`remove_var` are
  `unsafe` now (and racy under parallel tests). When you need env-dependent behavior,
  factor the logic into a pure helper that *takes* the env value as an argument (see
  `taski_config::config_path_from`). Don't sprinkle `unsafe` in tests to work around it.

- **`notify-debouncer-mini` doesn't report event *kind*.** You get "something changed,"
  not create/modify/delete. The daemon decides what to do by checking file existence.
  Don't assume you can branch on event type.

- **The single-writer lock is load-bearing (ADR-0008).** The daemon acquires
  `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on `<db_dir>/daemon.lock` before scanning. Two daemons would
  corrupt the vault — `atomic_write`'s fixed-name temp collision + `reconcile_note`'s
  read-modify-write race, *neither* guarded by ADR-0004's TOCTOU check and *both* invisible
  to WAL. `run_daemon` takes a `DaemonLockGuard` as a **capability token**: you cannot call
  it without acquiring the lock, and the guard can't be forged (its constructor is private).
  Don't add a daemon entry point that bypasses `acquire_daemon_lock`.

- **Combined mode routes daemon tracing to the log file, never stderr.** In `taski`
  (combined) the TUI owns the alternate screen; any `eprintln!` or `tracing`→stderr on the
  daemon thread garbles it. Daemon-thread events go to `<db_dir>/daemon.log` via
  `init_tracing_to_file`. If you add code that runs on the daemon thread, use `tracing`
  (not `eprintln!`). (`taski daemon` / standalone `taski-daemon` still use stderr — fine,
  no TUI.) The same applies to the **TUI thread itself**: never `eprintln!` from TUI code —
  the alternate screen is owned for the whole session, so errors are swallowed (see
  `sync_context` / `track_enqueued`) rather than written to stderr.

- **`ctrlc::set_handler` is process-global and single-install.** Only `taski daemon` and
  standalone `taski-daemon` install it. Combined mode must **not** — the TUI runs in
  crossterm raw mode, which swallows `SIGINT` and delivers it as a key event the TUI
  handles (driving the same shutdown path as `q`). Installing it from both paths errors.

- **`--once` and `--init-config` live only on `taski-daemon`, not on `taski`.** The
  unified `taski` binary exposes only the global `--vault`/`--db` flags plus the
  `daemon`/`tui` subcommands. For a one-shot scan or config generation, use the standalone
  `taski-daemon` binary.

- **The TUI does surface refused toggles** as a one-line notice (via `recent_actions` →
  `friendly_failure_reason`), cleared on the next action. But the TUI↔daemon coupling is
  loose *by choice*: `friendly_failure_reason` string-matches the daemon's `ApplyOutcome`
  phrases, with a generic fallback. A structured reason-code was considered and deferred
  (low value for a personal tool). If you change daemon error wording, sanity-check the
  TUI messages.

- **`friendly_failure_reason` and `render_failure_notice` are twin functions that must stay in sync.** Both map `ApplyOutcome`/`action_type` to user-facing text. `friendly_failure_reason` handles the reason text (✅/❌/scheduled glyph-keyed branches); `render_failure_notice` handles the verb + retry-key (per action_type). When adding a new action_type, add arms to BOTH. A refused quick-add initially fell through to 'Toggle/Space' because only one was updated — caught in review.

- **`exclude_dirs` SQL LIKE patterns need a trailing `%`.** When purging indexed tasks
  for an excluded directory, the SQL is `DELETE … WHERE note_path LIKE ?` with the bind
  value `_System/Templates/%`. The `%` is required — without it, LIKE matches only the
  literal directory path (and SQL's single-char `_` wildcard makes it hairier). If purge
  silently does nothing, check that the bind value ends with `/%`.

- **`taski-skip: true` is strict about the value (ADR-0017).** Only the literal boolean
  `true` (case-insensitive) or its quoted `"true"`/`'true'` variants suppress indexing.
  `yes`/`on`/`1`/empty are **not** honored (deliberate — explicit opt-in only), so
  "I set the flag but tasks still show" usually means a YAML-1.1 spelling. The flag must
  also be a **top-level** frontmatter key on a well-formed first-line `---`…`---` block
  (an unclosed block or an indented/nested key is ignored). Toggling the flag evicts/rehydrates
  rows on the next scan (~1s) via the normal reconciliation path — no manual purge.

- **Undo scope covers checkbox flips (`Space`, `d`, `i`), bullet toggles (`b`), and quick-add (`a` — removes the appended line). Not `t` (mark-for-today).** `u` undoes the
  last checkbox flip (cancel is a flip to `-` and in-progress to `/`, so both are covered), bullet toggle, or quick-add — not `t`
  (mark-for-today). The `t` gesture is already idempotent (pressing `t` again removes the
  mark), so undo adds little value. This is intentional, not a bug.

- **Tags are local-only.** `v0.1` and all commits exist only in the local repo until
  pushed. There is currently no remote set up in this working tree — confirm before
  assuming `git push` will work.

- **The `run_loop` branches on search state before normal key dispatch.** When
  `app.searching` or `app.file_searching` is true, most keystrokes build the search query
  instead of performing their normal action. This means adding a new keybinding requires
  checking whether it should also be available during a search prompt. So far only `Esc`
  and `Enter` are handled during both, and `Enter` just dismisses the prompt. (`o`
  open-in-Obsidian is normal-mode only — during a search prompt it builds the query.)
- **The `o` open-in-Obsidian spawn must keep null stdio and stay macOS-only for now.**
  `open_in_obsidian` calls `Command::new("open")` with `.stdout(Stdio::null())` +
  `.stderr(Stdio::null())` + `.spawn()` (fire-and-forget, never `.wait()`). Do NOT drop the
  null redirects — the alternate screen is owned for the whole session and any stdio from
  `open` would garble it. Cross-platform support (`xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows)
  is deferred; note `xdg-open` additionally requires **double-encoding** of URL parameter
  values (encode once, then encode the `%` signs to `%25`), which the current single-pass
  `percent_encode_query` does not produce — adding Linux means extending the encoder, not
  just swapping the launcher binary. `tracing` is now a `taski-tui` dep (was daemon/launcher
  only) so the TUI thread's `tracing::warn!` on spawn failure flows through the combined-mode
  subscriber rather than being swallowed.

- **Theme/density resolution happens before `enter_terminal()`.** Bad `[theme]` colors fall back per-role + `tracing::warn!`; bad `[ui]` percent clamps + warns. But a bad `list_density` *variant* is a serde error at `taski_config::load_from` time — `run_inner` returns `Err` before the alt screen is entered. Never resolve theme/prefs inside `draw` (it's too late to recover gracefully — the alt screen is already up).

---

## Development Workflow & Conventions

- **Vertical slices.** Work is organized as end-to-end slices (see PRD §12), each leaving
  the app runnable. We prove the riskiest thing (write-back) early, not last. Commit
  messages follow Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs(adr):`.

- **The gates are non-negotiable.** CI (macOS, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs exactly
  `fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, and `test` — **no** `cargo-deny`. Run those three
  locally before considering work done:
  `cargo fmt --all --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --all`.

- **Test the hard paths; property-test the invariants.** Write-back correctness is
  guarded by a 256-case proptest ("never corrupts": arbitrary task + arbitrary concurrent
  byte change → either the flip lands or it's refused, never corruption). The parser has
  a proptest for "never panics on arbitrary input." When you touch these areas, keep the
  proptests green — they encode the safety contract.

- **Decisions go through ADRs.** When you make (or revise) a load-bearing choice, record
  it in `docs/adr/` and update `tech.md`. Don't let important decisions live only in code
  comments or commit messages.

- **Keep `taski-core` pure.** No filesystem, no I/O, no deps on other taski crates. FS/
  config concerns go in `taski-config` or the binaries. This purity is what makes the
  parser cheaply testable.

- **Test both search modes.** `/` (text) and `F` (file) are independent TUI-side filters
  implemented in `build_view`. Tests cover each in isolation, case-insensitivity, compose
  with each other (text+file+status triple), and compose with status/Today filters. Since
  the search logic is pure (no DB/IO), tests live as inline unit tests in
  `crates/taski-tui/src/lib.rs`.

## Testing Strategy

| Location | What it guards |
|---|---|
| `taski-core` unit tests + `proptest` + `rewrite_scheduled_proptest` + `tag_extraction_proptest` + `inbox_line_proptest` | Parser correctness on a synthetic corpus; never-panics on arbitrary input; due/scheduled/start/created/done/cancelled date extraction; `extract_priority` (incl. the `⏫`=High / `🔺`=Highest mapping); `extract_tags` grammar + dedup; pure `rewrite_scheduled` oracle (256-case ADR-0009 Phase 2); tag-extraction grammar + dedup proptest (256 cases); `inbox_line_for` construction oracle (256-case ADR-0014); `taski_skip_enabled` frontmatter opt-out detector grammar (ADR-0017 — first-line `---` block, top-level key only, literal `true` truthiness, CRLF, unclosed-block, nested-key, prefix-key, fenced-decoy cases). |
| `taski-config` unit tests | TOML parsing, precedence (CLI→config→default), env override, `template()` round-trips, `obsidian_vault`/`use_advanced_uri` deserialize + default-absent (ADR-0015); `ThemeConfig`/`UiConfig` deserialize + default-absent; `template()` round-trip with `[theme]`/`[ui]` blocks (ADR-0018). |
| `taski-db` unit tests | Schema, `reconcile_note` identity retention, upsert/read round-trips (incl. Tier 1 metadata + the tag sentinel storage format), action pruning, `open()` creates missing dirs. |
| `taski-daemon/tests/scan.rs` | End-to-end scan of a fake vault → correct task rows; `taski-skip` frontmatter suppresses indexing and **evicts** tasks when the flag is toggled onto an already-indexed note (ADR-0017). |
| `taski-daemon/tests/reconcile.rs` | Content-hash reconciliation: identity survives edits, deletes, reorders. |
| `taski-daemon/tests/writeback.rs` + `writeback_proptest.rs` + `metadata_writeback_proptest.rs` + `done_date_writeback_proptest.rs` + `cancelled_date_writeback_proptest.rs` + `quick_add_writeback_proptest.rs` | The safety contract: atomic_write commits on match, refuses on conflict, never corrupts; `⏳` metadata write-back "never corrupts" (256-case ADR-0009 Phase 2, oracle = `rewrite_scheduled`); `✅` done-date-on-toggle stamp "never corrupts" (256-case ADR-0012, oracle = `rewrite_done_date`, CRLF assertion, VS16 guards); `❌` cancelled-date-on-cancel stamp "never corrupts" (256-case ADR-0013, oracle = `rewrite_cancelled_date`; also exercises cross-state `✅`-clearing); quick-add append/create "never corrupts" (256-case ADR-0014, oracle = `inbox_line_for`; also covers first-creation and undo removal). Also covers `toggle_bullet` and `undo` action types (ADR-0011). |
| `taski-daemon/src/lock.rs` unit tests | The `flock` single-writer lock: acquire/refuse outcome, lock-path derivation. |
| `taski-daemon` unit tests in `lib.rs` | `should_exclude_entry`, `path_matches_exclude`, `scan_vault_with_exclude_dirs_skips_matching_directory` — exclude-dir filtering in WalkDir and watcher events. |
| `taski-tui` unit tests (in `lib.rs`) | View model: grouping (folder+note/note/tag/priority/folder via `G`, incl. the filename-only `note` merge, tag fan-out + group ordering), collapse, five-axis filter composition (status + today + overdue + text search + file search), display-index↔Task mapping, selection reconciliation (incl. duplicate task_ids under tag grouping), failure-notice surfacing, context-pane render/scroll/toggle + `context_view` centering (headless `TestBackend` smoke), and the pure `obsidian_url` + `percent_encode_query` deep-link builder (native vs advanced, RFC 3986 component encoding incl. unicode; ADR-0015), and the `?` help-overlay modal dispatch (`help_dismisses_on`) + headless `TestBackend` render smoke; `Theme::default()` byte-equality with today's palette, per-role fallback on bad `ColorSpec`, `LayoutPrefs` clamp range, `TestBackend` buffer assertions on a non-default theme + a 60/40 pane split; `split_note_header` path/filename split + a `TestBackend` assertion that Note headers dim the dir prefix (`path_prefix`) while the filename keeps the default fg (not dimmed, not bold — the global `bold` toggle is off by default); an end-to-end `TestBackend` check that a configured `accent` hex reaches rendered cells; and that a configured `background` fills every cell while `Reset` (default) paints none (ADR-0018). |
| `taski-db` unit tests | `delete_tasks_for_excluded_dirs` — verifies exact-match and prefix-match SQL purges the right rows. |
| `taski` (unified launcher) | No unit tests by design — it's thin dispatch over the two libraries. Correctness is runtime-verified (combined spawn, attach-when-held, refuse-when-held, quit-drain); see the smokes described in ADRs 0007/0008. |

Tests use `tempfile` fake vaults and `:memory:` or temp-file DBs. The real vault is
exercised only at runtime (its `taski.db` is gitignored).

## Quick Reference — "I want to…"

| Task | Look at |
|---|---|
| Change how tasks are parsed / add metadata extraction | `taski-core/src/lib.rs` (`parse_tasks`, `extract_due_date`/`extract_scheduled_date`/`extract_start_date`/`extract_created_date`/`extract_done_date`/`extract_cancelled_date` via shared `extract_emoji_date`, `extract_priority`, `extract_tags`, `Priority` enum, `ymd_from_unix`) |
| Change the DB schema | `taski-db::SCHEMA` + bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`; update `reconcile_note`/`upsert_task` |
| Cache/read note content for the TUI context pane | `taski-db`: `note_contents` table + `upsert_note_content`/`note_content`/`delete_note_content`; daemon writes it in `index_note` ([ADR-0006](./adr/0006-note-content-cached-in-index.md)) |
| Change write-back behavior | `taski-daemon`: `process_action` (checkbox flips + `✅` stamp, ADR-0012) / `process_metadata_action` (`⏳` writes, ADR-0009), `atomic_write` (mind ADR-0004 TOCTOU); the drain loop dispatches on `pending_actions.action_type` |
| Change how the TUI looks/behaves | `taski-tui/src/lib.rs`: `App`, `build_view` (filter pipeline), `context_view`/`draw_context_pane`, key handling in `run_loop` |
| Change the TUI filter composition / grouping | `crates/taski-tui/src/lib.rs:build_view()` — ANDs five filter axes (status + today + overdue + text search + file search) and buckets survivors by the `G` grouping axis (folder+note/note/tag/priority/folder; HashMap-based, tag fan-out). The 9-param function carries a documented `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` (a parameter-struct refactor is deferred). |
| Change keybindings (add/remove a key) | `crates/taski-tui/src/lib.rs:run_loop()` — handles three branches: `searching`, `file_searching`, and normal mode. `b` / `u` added in ADR-0011; `d` (cancel) added in ADR-0013; `i` (in-progress) added in ADR-0016 |
| Change context-pane keybindings/behavior | `taski-tui/src/lib.rs` key match in `run_loop` (`J`/`K` scroll, `p` toggle) + `MIN_SPLIT_WIDTH` auto-hide; `sync_context` for the read path |
| Change open-in-Obsidian behavior | `crates/taski-tui/src/lib.rs`: `obsidian_url`/`percent_encode_query` (pure URL builder + encoder), `open_in_obsidian` (spawn helper), `run_loop` `o` key; `crates/taski-config/src/lib.rs`: `obsidian_vault`/`use_advanced_uri` fields; ADR-0015 |
| Add/change vault directory exclusions | Add `exclude_dirs` to `~/.config/taski/config.toml`; restart daemon. Purge happens on startup — see `delete_tasks_for_excluded_dirs` in `taski-db`, `should_exclude_entry`/`path_matches_exclude` in `taski-daemon` |
| Suppress a single note's tasks via frontmatter | `taski-core::taski_skip_enabled` (pure first-line-frontmatter detector); the `index_note` guard in `taski-daemon` reconciles with an empty list to evict. Set `taski-skip: true` in the note's YAML frontmatter; ADR-0017 |
| Change undo behavior | `taski-tui/src/lib.rs` `submit_undo` (enqueues the reverse via `db::enqueue_action` for checkbox undo, `db::enqueue_bullet_toggle` for bullet undo, or `db::enqueue_quick_add_undo` for quick-add undo — `LastAction::QuickAdd` arm); daemon dispatches to `process_action` / `process_bullet_action` / `process_quick_add_undo` like other action types |
| Change quick-add behavior | `crates/taski-tui/src/lib.rs`: `start_quick_add`/`submit_quick_add`/`clear_quick_add`, `run_loop` `a` key + `quick_adding` branch; `crates/taski-daemon/src/lib.rs`: `process_quick_add`/`process_quick_add_undo`; ADR-0014 |
| Change launcher behavior (combined/daemon/tui dispatch, attach-or-spawn, shutdown handshake) | `crates/taski/src/main.rs` (`run_combined`/`run_combined_spawn`/`run_daemon_only`); ADR-0007 |
| Change the single-writer lock | `crates/taski-daemon/src/lock.rs` (ADR-0008) |
| Add a CLI flag | `Cli` struct in the relevant binary's `lib.rs`/`main.rs` |
| Change config format/precedence | `taski-config/src/lib.rs` |
| Run the app (daemon + TUI combined) | `taski` (unified binary); see [setup.md](./setup.md) |
| Run the daemon only | `taski daemon` (or the standalone `taski-daemon`) |
| Run the TUI only | `taski tui` (or `taski-tui`); a reader, safe alongside any running daemon |
| Run a one-shot scan (no watcher) | `taski-daemon --once --vault …` |
| Generate a config file | `taski-daemon --init-config --vault …` (full reference: `docs/config.md`) |
| Inspect the index / pending actions | `sqlite3 <db> "SELECT …"` (see Debugging) |
| Add a new dependency | add to `[workspace.dependencies]` + the crate; record in `tech.md` |
| Recolor the TUI | `[theme]` in `~/.config/taski/config.toml`; restart. See `docs/config.md` + the theme gallery `docs/themes/` (opencode, Catppuccin, Tokyo Night, Nord, Gruvbox, Light) / `docs/features/theming.md`; ADR-0018 |
| Turn bold on/off | `bold` in `[theme]` (global, off by default); routes through `Theme::bold_modifier()`; ADR-0018 |
| Change task-list / context-pane proportions | `[ui].list_pane_percent` in config (20–80); ADR-0018 |
| Understand *why* something is the way it is | check `docs/adr/` first, then git history |

## Deferred / Intentionally Not Done (so you don't "fix" non-bugs)

A holistic review triaged these as low-value for a personal single-user tool. They are
**deliberately absent**, not oversights:

- **Retry-once on write-back conflict** — the daemon refuses and surfaces failure; manual
  retry is fine for one user.
- **`fsync` of the parent directory** after rename (M5 durability) — acceptable risk for
  personal notes.
- **Unique temp-file names** (L2) — the single-writer model makes collisions near-impossible.
- **Optimistic TUI updates** (flip the checkbox locally before the daemon confirms) —
  current behavior waits for confirmation; simpler and never lies.
- **`pulldown-cmark`** for parsing — the line-based parser handles checkboxes fine; adopt
  only when real edge cases (nested lists, callouts, inline code) actually bite.
- **Structured write-back reason-codes** between daemon and TUI — string matching + fallback.
- **Real DB migration path** — schema bumps drop+recreate (pre-MVP).
- **Additional write-back token types** — `⏳` (scheduled, ADR-0009 Phase 2), `✅` (done,
  ADR-0012 — stamped on `[ ]`→`[x]` toggle, cleared on `[x]`→`[ ]`), and `❌` (cancelled,
  ADR-0013 — stamped on `[ ]`→`[-]` cancel, cleared on `[-]`→`[ ]`; cross-state flips clear
  the other stamp) are the three metadata *writes* admitted alongside checkbox flips per
  the ADR-0003 principled boundary. Tier 1 added **read-only parsing** of six more tokens
  (`#tags`, priority, start/created/done/cancelled dates — schema v6). Writing the remaining
  tokens (`🛫` start, priority emojis, `🔁` recurrence) from the TUI remains
  deferred — each would need its own ADR, pure rewrite oracle, and proptest under the
  ADR-0009 grammar-provability gate. The three dated tokens (`⏳`/`✅`/`❌`) likely exhaust
  the admissible set under that gate.
- **Case-sensitive search toggle** — search is case-insensitive; a future config toggle
  could make it case-sensitive. Not needed for MVP (ADR-0010).
- **Search by date fields beyond Overdue/Today** — `O` (overdue: `due_date < today`) and
  `T` (today: `scheduled_date == today`) cover the common date-filter cases; arbitrary
  date-range search (e.g. "due this week") is a natural extension but deferred. Text (`/`)
  and file (`F`) search remain substring-only.
- **Undo of `t` (mark-for-today)** — explicitly excluded from undo scope; `t` is already
  idempotent (ADR-0011).
- **External change detection for undo** — undo only reverses the last TUI action, not
  external vault edits. Detecting external edits to offer "revert" is a separate problem.
- **Cross-platform `o` (open-in-Obsidian) launcher** — the `o` gesture uses macOS `open(1)`
  (ADR-0015). Linux (`xdg-open`) and Windows (`start`) are deferred; note `xdg-open` requires
  double-encoding of URL parameter values, which the current single-encoder does not produce.
- **In-TUI failure notice for `o`** — spawn failures currently `tracing::warn!` only; a visible
   one-line notice (parallel to write-back's `render_failure_notice`) is deferred to avoid
   conflating local-OS failures with `pending_actions` lifecycle.
- **Pane-zoom key** (`z`, lazygit-style expand-focused-pane) — the plumbing lands free with
   ADR-0018 (LayoutPrefs already flow into draw); the state design (transient vs persistent,
   which pane is focused, interaction with `p` toggle) is deferred.
- **Runtime `:theme` switching** — config-driven theming first; a TUI command mode that mutates
   the `Theme` struct at runtime can layer on later without a new ADR.
- **Distribution / packaging / GUI / multi-vault / collaboration** — out of MVP scope (PRD §14).

If you pick one up, record the decision and update this list.

## Glossary

- **Write-back** — reflecting a TUI action into the originating Markdown note, via the
  daemon. Action types: **checkbox flips** (`[ ]↔[x]`, ADR-0003), **`⏳` scheduled-date
  writes** (`set_scheduled`, ADR-0009 Phase 2), **`toggle_bullet`** (ADR-0011), and
  **quick-add** append-only creation (`quick_add`/`quick_add_undo`, ADR-0014). All reuse
  the same `atomic_write` TOCTOU guard (first-creation via `atomic_create` skips the
  re-hash — bounded ADR-0004 exception).
- **Scheduled date (`⏳`)** — Obsidian Tasks-plugin syntax for "plan to work on this." Taski
  parses it, indexes it in `tasks.scheduled_date`, offers a **Today view** (`T`)
  of tasks whose scheduled date == today, and provides a **mark-for-today** toggle (`t`)
  that writes `⏳ <today>` into the note line (ADR-0009).
- **Today view** — the `T`-key toggled filter that shows only tasks whose
  `scheduled_date == today` (computed by `taski_core::ymd_from_unix`). Orthogonal to the
  `f` status-cycle.
- **Mark-for-today** — the `t` toggle gesture on a selected task. Idempotent: if the task
  already has `⏳ today`, pressing `t` removes it (writes `NULL`). The TUI enqueues a
  `set_scheduled` `pending_actions` row; the daemon dispatches to
  `process_metadata_action` → `rewrite_scheduled` → `atomic_write`.
- **Text search** — `/` key modal search that filters the task list by case-insensitive
  substring of `task.text`. Enter keeps the filter; Esc clears it. Independently composes
  with file search, status, and Today filters (ADR-0010).
- **File search** — `F` key modal search that filters the task list by case-insensitive
  substring of `task.note_path`. Same interaction pattern as text search. Both searches
  AND together when both are active (ADR-0010).
- **`rewrite_scheduled`** — the pure oracle in `taski-core` that takes a task line and a
  desired scheduled date, and returns a `RewriteResult` (Unchanged, Rewritten(String), or
  Unparseable). Called by `process_metadata_action`; guarded by its own 256-case proptest.
  Backed by a shared `rewrite_emoji_date` core (ADR-0012 generalized it from the `⏳`-specific
  body).
- **`rewrite_done_date`** — the pure oracle for the `✅` done-date stamp (ADR-0012). A
  one-line wrapper over the same `rewrite_emoji_date` core as `rewrite_scheduled`, but on the
  `✅` token. Called by `process_action_at` when a checkbox flip transitions to/from Done;
  guarded by its own 256-case proptest.
- **`rewrite_cancelled_date`** — the pure oracle for the `❌` cancelled-date stamp (ADR-0013).
  A one-line wrapper over the same `rewrite_emoji_date` core as `rewrite_scheduled`/
  `rewrite_done_date`, but on the `❌` token. Called by `process_action_at` when a checkbox
  flip transitions to/from Cancelled (`-`); guarded by its own 256-case proptest.
- **Cancel** — the `d` keybinding that flips the selected task to the Obsidian cancelled
  state (`- [ ]` → `- [-]`), composing a `❌ <today>` stamp into the same byte buffer as the
  flip. Press `d` again to un-cancel (`[-]` → `[ ]`, clears `❌`). Implemented as a `checkbox`
  action with `new_char='-'` (no new action_type, no schema change), so `u` undo reuses the
  existing checkbox-flip reversal path (ADR-0013).
- **In-progress toggle** — the `i` keybinding that flips the selected task to the Obsidian
  in-progress state (`- [ ]` → `- [/]`). Press `i` again to re-open (`[/]` → `[ ]`). Implemented
  as a `checkbox` action with `new_char='/'` (no new action_type, no schema change, no stamp),
  mirroring `d`/cancel. The daemon skips the `✅`/`❌` stamp oracles for `/` flips, so a done
  task marked in-progress keeps its `✅` (and a cancelled task keeps its `❌`) — accepted as
  coherent. `u` undo reuses the existing checkbox-flip reversal path (ADR-0016).
- **Bullet toggle** — the `b` keybinding that converts a checkbox task to a plain bullet
  (`- [ ] task` → `- task`) or back. Implemented as `toggle_bullet` action type, routed
  through the same daemon pipeline (ADR-0011).
- **Undo** — the `u` keybinding that reverses the last checkbox flip (`Space`, `d`, `i`), bullet
  toggle (`b`), or quick-add (`a` — removes the appended line). Queues the reverse action
  immediately; the daemon re-verifies current state, so a failed original naturally fails
  the undo too (ADR-0011/0014).
- **Quick-add** — the `a` keybinding that opens a text-entry modal; Enter appends
  `- [ ] <text> ➕ <today>` to the designated inbox note. The first content-creation
  feature (ADR-0014), opening a new gate class (bounded append-only creation) distinct
  from the grammar-provability token gate.
- **`inbox_line_for`** — the pure construction oracle in `taski-core` that builds a
  canonical task line with `➕ <today>` created-date stamp. Strips embedded newlines
  (single-line only). Called by the daemon's `process_quick_add`; guarded by its own
  proptest.
- **Inbox note** — the designated Markdown file (default `task-inbox.md`, configurable via
  `inbox_path` in config) that quick-add appends to. A capture surface (GTD-style inbox),
  not a curated note — the user reviews and moves tasks out of it in Obsidian.
- **`action_type`** — the column on `pending_actions` (schema v5) that distinguishes
  `checkbox` flips, `set_scheduled` writes, `toggle_bullet` toggles, `undo` actions, and
  `quick_add`/`quick_add_undo` (ADR-0014). The daemon drain loop dispatches on it.
- **Reconciliation** — re-matching a note's freshly-parsed tasks to existing index rows by
  `text_hash`, preserving surrogate `id`s (ADR-0005).
- **TOCTOU** — time-of-check-to-time-of-use; the race between reading a file and writing
  it. Guarded in `atomic_write` by re-hashing immediately before rename.
- **Surrogate identity** — a `tasks.id` that is an arbitrary autoincrement integer, not
  derived from the task's content or location, so it survives edits.
- **`pending_actions`** — the SQLite table that is the TUI→daemon command channel.
- **WAL** — SQLite's Write-Ahead Logging mode; enables one writer + many readers across
  processes (daemon writes, TUI reads).
- **Combined mode** — running the daemon (background thread) + TUI (main thread) in one
  `taski` process, the daemon's lifetime scoped to the TUI session (ADR-0007).
- **Attach-or-spawn** — `taski`'s lock-probe on startup: spawn the daemon if the
  single-writer lock is free, else attach (run the TUI-only against the running daemon).
  `taski daemon` refuses instead of attaching (ADR-0008).
- **Single-writer lock** — `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` on `<db_dir>/daemon.lock`, held for
  the daemon's lifetime and auto-released by the OS on crash; guarantees one daemon writes
  the vault/index (ADR-0008).
- **ShutdownSignal** — a shared `Arc<AtomicBool>` (`ShutdownSignal` to set, `ShutdownHandle`
  to check) used to cooperatively stop the daemon; in combined mode the TUI's quit hook
  sets it.
- **Open in Obsidian** — the `o` keybinding that builds an `obsidian://` deep link from the
  selected task's `note_path` (+ `line_number`) and hands it to macOS `open`, focusing
  Obsidian at the task's source note. Read-only and TUI-local — no vault mutation, no daemon
  round-trip (ADR-0015). Native `obsidian://open` by default (opens the file); `use_advanced_uri = true`
  switches to `obsidian://advanced-uri?…&line=` for exact-line jumping (requires the Advanced
  URI community plugin). The pure `obsidian_url` builder + hand-rolled `percent_encode_query`
  encoder live in `taski-tui`. macOS-only (`open`); `xdg-open`/`start` deferred.
