# ADR-0014: Quick-add — bounded append-only task creation to a designated inbox

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-21
- **Decides:** How Taski enables the user to create a new task from the TUI without leaving it — a single-line text-entry modal (`a` key) that appends `- [ ] <text> ➕ <today>` to a configurable inbox note (default `task-inbox.md`, created if missing). **Amends [ADR-0003](./0003-checkbox-only-mvp.md)** for a fourth time and opens a **new gate class** — bounded append-only creation — distinct from the grammar-provability token gate of ADRs 0009/0012/0013.

## Context

All prior write-back features (ADRs 0003/0009/0011/0012/0013) operate on **existing** task lines — flipping checkboxes, stamping date emojis, toggling bullet format. The user could act on tasks already in the vault but could not **capture** a new task without switching to Obsidian. This ADR introduces quick-add: the first content-creation feature.

### Why this needs a new gate, not the grammar-provability gate

ADR-0009 established the grammar-provability gate: Taski may write tokens that (i) are standard Obsidian Tasks syntax, (ii) have a single insertion grammar, and (iii) are produced by a pure proptested line-rewrite. `⏳`/`✅`/`❌` were admitted under it. But quick-add writes **arbitrary user text** (`- [ ] <user-typed-text> ➕ <today>`), and free text fails gate (ii) — there is no single insertion grammar for arbitrary content. So the grammar-provability gate does not apply.

Instead, this ADR opens a **separate, narrower gate** — bounded append-only creation — with its own principled boundary:

> Taski may append a new well-formed checkbox-task line to a **designated inbox note**, provided (i) the operation is **append-only** (never modifies, reorders, or deletes existing lines), (ii) the appended line is canonical Tasks-plugin checkbox syntax with a `➕ <today>` created-date stamp, and (iii) the write uses the same `atomic_write` TOCTOU discipline (or a first-creation path with no conflict surface). Arbitrary-note creation, mid-note insertion, text editing, and line deletion remain explicitly rejected.

The key structural distinction from hard-delete (considered in depth and rejected in ADR-0013's Alternatives): append adds to the end of a file and **shifts no existing lines** — there is no positional chaos, no line-number reconciliation, no `expected_note_hash` column needed. Delete removes a line and shifts every subsequent line's number, requiring positional re-insertion oracles and a schema bump. Append is structurally simpler and strictly safer.

### Why the `➕ <today>` stamp

Same argument as ADR-0012's `✅` and ADR-0013's `❌`, applied to creation:

- (i) `➕ YYYY-MM-DD` is canonical Tasks-plugin created-date syntax, human-readable and consumed by Tasks/Dataview for sort/filter.
- (ii) Composing the stamp into the appended line (not a separate write) keeps it one write, one hash, one rename.
- (iii) The created-date has triage value: the user sees when each inbox task was captured.

`➕` was previously a **read-only** token (Tier 1 parsing, schema v6: `extract_created_date`). This ADR makes it the fourth written token (`⏳`/`✅`/`❌`/`➕`), but the first written in a **creation** context rather than an edit of an existing line.

## Decision

### The action model

A new `quick_add` action_type in `pending_actions`, enqueued by the TUI when the user commits the modal. **No schema change (v6 unchanged)** — the existing NOT NULL columns carry well-documented sentinel values for unused fields, consistent with the established pattern (`expected_char`/`new_char` are already "unused for non-checkbox action types"):

| Column | Value for `quick_add` | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | `0` | No existing task (sentinel; no FK constraint in schema). |
| `note_path` | `<inbox_path>` | The note being appended to (vault-relative). |
| `line_number` | `0` | No existing line — append, not edit. |
| `expected_char` | `''` | Unused (non-checkbox action). |
| `new_char` | `''` | Unused. |
| `action_type` | `'quick_add'` | Dispatch key. |
| `payload` | `<task text>` | The user-typed text. |

### The pure oracle

A construction oracle (simpler than the rewrite oracles — it builds a line, not edits one):

```rust
const CREATED_EMOJI: char = '➕';

pub fn inbox_line_for(text: &str, today: &str) -> String {
    format!("- [ ] {text} {CREATED_EMOJI} {today}")
}
```

No `RewriteResult` — there is no existing line to fail on. The oracle is pure and proptested: never produces malformed syntax, handles empty text, strips embedded newlines (single-line only), and preserves text containing emoji dates verbatim (the user can fix in Obsidian).

### The daemon write path

`process_quick_add(action)`:

1. Resolve the inbox: `vault_root.join(&action.note_path)` (the `note_path` column carries the inbox path).
2. Construct the line: `taski_core::inbox_line_for(payload, ymd_from_unix(unix_now()))`.
3. **If the inbox exists:** read it, append the line (prepend `\n` if the file lacks a trailing newline), `atomic_write` with the pre-append hash as `expected_hash` (standard TOCTOU — ADR-0004 reused unchanged).
4. **If the inbox does NOT exist:** write it directly (temp → fsync → rename) with the single line as content. No TOCTOU re-hash — a non-existent file has no state to conflict with. This is a deliberate, bounded exception to ADR-0004, justified below.
5. On success: re-index the inbox note. The scanner parses the new line and `reconcile_note` inserts the task row. The task appears in the TUI on next poll (~750 ms).

### The first-creation path (bounded ADR-0004 exception)

`atomic_write` returns `WriteResult::Conflict` on `ErrorKind::NotFound` (the re-read at the TOCTOU guard treats a missing file as a conflict). Quick-add must handle first-creation explicitly: if the file does not exist, create it without the TOCTOU re-hash. This is safe because:

- A non-existent file has no prior state — there is nothing to conflict with.
- The temp → fsync → rename sequence is still atomic (the rename is atomic on POSIX).
- The created file is immediately eligible for normal `atomic_write` on subsequent quick-adds.

The exception is bounded to the first-creation path only; every subsequent append uses the full TOCTOU guard unchanged.

### Undo

Undo of quick-add (`u` after `a`) removes the appended line. This is the first **content-removing** undo (all prior undos flip a checkbox or bullet back). It is safe because:

- The appended line is **positionally known** (the last line of the inbox, or the only line on first-creation).
- The appended line is **content-known** (Taski wrote it; the daemon can verify it matches `inbox_line_for(text, today)` before removing).
- If the inbox was edited externally between append and undo, the TOCTOU hash check catches the mismatch and refuses.

The TUI records `LastAction::QuickAdd { inbox_path, text }`. On undo, it enqueues a `quick_add_undo` action (separate action_type, dispatched separately in the drain loop — keeps the existing `undo` handler clean). The daemon reads the inbox, verifies the last line matches the expected content, removes it via `atomic_write`, and re-indexes. The restart limitation is unchanged: if `last_action` is cleared on restart, the appended line persists and the user removes it manually in Obsidian (same documented edge as checkbox undo).

### The TUI gesture

New `a` key opens a single-line text-entry modal (`quick_adding` state, mirroring `searching`/`file_searching`):

- `a` → enter modal (footer shows `> ` prompt with blinking cursor).
- Characters accumulate in `quick_add_query` (no `rebuild()` call — no filter to recompute, unlike search).
- `Enter` → `submit_quick_add(conn)`: enqueues the `quick_add` action, records `LastAction::QuickAdd`, exits modal.
- `Esc` → cancel (clears query, exits modal).
- `Backspace` → pop last char.
- All normal-mode keys (`d`, `b`, `Space`, `u`, etc.) suppressed during modal (same `else if app.quick_adding` branch as search).

### Config plumbing

New `inbox_path: Option<String>` on `Config`. `resolve_inbox_path(&cfg) -> String` mirrors `resolve_db`: config value → default `"task-inbox.md"`. The TUI's `run_inner` (which already loads `cfg` at line 105) resolves it and threads it through `run_loop` → `App::new`. No launcher changes (~4 lines). `template()` gains a commented `# inbox_path = "task-inbox.md"` line.

## Implementation Notes

1. **`taski-core/src/lib.rs`** — add `CREATED_EMOJI` const (`'➕'`, alongside `CANCELLED_EMOJI`); add `inbox_line_for(text, today) -> String` pure oracle; optionally update `extract_created_date` to reference the new const. Add a proptest for construction correctness and edge cases (empty text, embedded newlines stripped, text containing `✅`/`❌`/`📅` preserved verbatim).

2. **`taski-config/src/lib.rs`** — add `pub inbox_path: Option<String>` to `Config` (derive Default → `None`, serde auto-deserializes); add `resolve_inbox_path(&cfg) -> String` mirroring `resolve_db`; extend `template()` with an inbox_path line.

3. **`taski-db/src/lib.rs`** — add `enqueue_quick_add(note_path, text)` (INSERT with sentinel values per the table above); add `enqueue_quick_add_undo(note_path, text)`; extend `PendingAction` struct + `pending_actions()` SELECT to surface the new action types.

4. **`taski-daemon/src/lib.rs`** — add `process_quick_add` (existence branch → append via `atomic_write`, or first-creation via temp→fsync→rename); add `process_quick_add_undo` (verify-last-line-matches → remove via `atomic_write` → re-index); wire both into the drain loop's `action_type` dispatch. Add the first-creation helper.

5. **`taski-tui/src/lib.rs`** — add `quick_adding: bool`, `quick_add_query: String`, `inbox_path: String` to `App`; add `start_quick_add`/`push_quick_add_char`/`pop_quick_add_char`/`finish_quick_add`/`clear_quick_add` (mirroring search, minus `rebuild()`); add `submit_quick_add(conn)` (enqueue + record `LastAction::QuickAdd`); extend `run_loop` with `else if app.quick_adding` branch + `KeyCode::Char('a')` in normal mode; extend footer render with the modal prompt; add `LastAction::QuickAdd` variant + `submit_undo` arm; thread `inbox_path` through `run_inner` → `run_loop` → `App::new`.

6. **Proptest** — `crates/taski-daemon/tests/quick_add_writeback_proptest.rs`: 256 cases covering append to existing inbox (various trailing-newline states, concurrent edits) and first-creation (non-existent inbox). Assert: either the line lands correctly with existing content preserved, or a concurrent edit is refused — never corruption. Mirror the structure of `cancelled_date_writeback_proptest.rs`.

## Rationale

- **It's the first creation feature, and append is the safest possible creation.** Appending to the end of a designated file shifts no existing lines, requires no positional reconciliation, and has an unambiguous target position. General creation (mid-note insertion) and deletion are structurally riskier and remain rejected.
- **The inbox is a capture surface, not a curated note.** The user's stated workflow: quick-add captures tasks into an inbox; the user reviews and moves them later in Obsidian. This matches GTD-style inbox processing and keeps Taski's write surface narrow.
- **No schema bump.** The existing `pending_actions` columns carry sentinel values for unused fields, consistent with the established "unused for non-checkbox action types" pattern. A schema v7 redesign (nullable columns or a separate `pending_creates` table) was considered and deferred — the sentinel approach is adequate for a personal tool and avoids a destructive migration.
- **`➕ <today>` is composed into the appended line, not a separate write.** Same argument as ADR-0012/0013: one write, one hash, one rename.
- **First-creation without TOCTOU is safe.** A non-existent file has no state to conflict with; the temp → fsync → rename is still atomic. The exception is bounded to first-creation only; subsequent appends use the full TOCTOU guard.
- **Undo is safe because the line is known.** The appended line's position (last) and content (Taski wrote it) are both known; the daemon verifies before removing.

### Why this does not violate ADR-0005

`➕ YYYY-MM-DD` is native Obsidian Tasks created-date syntax (human-readable, consumed by Tasks/Dataview), not the foreign opaque identity marker ADR-0005 rejected. The user-typed text is the user's own content, not an injected marker. The surrogate-id + content-hash reconciliation mechanism is untouched — when the inbox is re-indexed after append, `reconcile_note` inserts the new task with a fresh surrogate `id`. **ADR-0005 is not amended.**

## Consequences

- ✅ The user can capture tasks from the TUI without switching to Obsidian.
- ✅ `atomic_write` and ADR-0004 are reused for existing-file appends; the first-creation path is a bounded, justified exception.
- ✅ ADR-0005 is not crossed (`➕` is native syntax, text is user content).
- ✅ No schema bump (sentinel values in existing columns).
- ✅ Undo works (`u` removes the appended line; first content-removing undo, safe because the line is positionally and contentually known).
- ⚠️ **ADR-0003 is amended a fourth time**: write-back scope widens to include bounded append-only creation to a designated inbox. The grammar-provability gate (ADRs 0009/0012/0013) is **unchanged** — this amendment opens a **new gate class** (bounded append-only creation), not an extension of the token gate.
- ⚠️ `pending_actions` carries sentinel values (`0`, `''`, `0`) for `quick_add` rows — documented but semantically weak. If a future action type also lacks these fields, a schema v7 redesign should be considered.
- ⚠️ The `a` key is consumed for quick-add. The `u` undo scope widens (now covers quick-add removal in addition to checkbox flips, cancels, and bullet toggles).
- ⚠️ User text containing emoji dates (`✅`, `❌`, `📅`, `⏳`) is preserved verbatim — the scanner will parse them as metadata. This is a known edge case; the user can fix in Obsidian.

### Cross-reference note — ADR-0003 (fourth amendment)

ADR-0003's amendment block must record a **fourth** amendment. Unlike the prior three (which widened the token set under the grammar-provability gate), this amendment opens a **new gate class**:

> The write-back scope is widened from **checkbox-state flips + `⏳`/`✅`/`❌` date-emoji stamps** to also include **bounded append-only task creation** to a designated inbox note (`quick_add` action). The ADR-0009 grammar-provability gate is **unchanged** and still governs token writes. A new, separate gate governs creation: Taski may append a well-formed checkbox-task line (with `➕ <today>` created-date stamp) to a designated inbox note, provided the operation is append-only (no modification / reorder / deletion of existing lines), uses the standard `atomic_write` TOCTOU discipline (or a first-creation path with no conflict surface), and re-indexes after write. Arbitrary-note creation, mid-note insertion, text editing, and line deletion remain explicitly rejected.

## Alternatives considered

- **General creation (arbitrary note, arbitrary position).** Rejected: mid-note insertion shifts subsequent line numbers, requiring positional reconciliation and a far more complex oracle. Append-only to a designated inbox is the narrowest opening that delivers value.
- **Bare `- [ ] text` (no `➕` stamp).** Rejected at user direction: the `➕` stamp provides created-date triage value and Tasks-plugin interop, consistent with the `✅`/`❌` convention established by ADRs 0012/0013.
- **Schema v7 (nullable `task_id` or a separate `pending_creates` table).** Considered and deferred: the sentinel-value approach is adequate for a personal tool, consistent with the existing "unused for non-checkbox action types" pattern, and avoids a destructive migration. If a second creation-class action type is added, revisit.
- **Optimistic TUI display (show the task before the daemon confirms).** Rejected (consistent with existing policy — see context.md "Deferred"): the TUI waits for daemon confirmation; simpler and never lies.
- **Multi-line entry.** Rejected: single-line modal is simpler and sufficient for inbox capture. Multi-line would complicate the oracle and the undo semantics.
- **Recurring-task stamp (`🔁`) on creation.** Rejected: out of scope; `🔁` is not yet a written token and would need its own ADR under the grammar-provability gate.

## Edge cases

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Inbox exists, ends with `\n` | Append `- [ ] text ➕ today\n` directly. |
| Inbox exists, no trailing `\n` | Append `\n- [ ] text ➕ today\n` (prepend newline). |
| Inbox does not exist | Create with `- [ ] text ➕ today\n` as sole content (first-creation path, no TOCTOU). |
| Inbox exists, concurrent Obsidian edit | Hash mismatch → `ConflictNoteChanged` → refuse (ADR-0004, unchanged for existing-file path). |
| Empty text (Enter on empty query) | Refuse at TUI layer (do not enqueue); modal exits with no action. |
| Text contains embedded newline | Strip at TUI or oracle layer (single-line only). |
| Text contains `✅`/`❌`/`📅`/`⏳` | Preserved verbatim; scanner parses as metadata. Known edge case; user can fix in Obsidian. |
| Undo after quick-add, inbox unchanged | Verify last line matches expected content; remove via `atomic_write`; re-index. |
| Undo after quick-add, inbox edited externally | Hash mismatch → refuse; user removes the line manually in Obsidian. |
| Undo after quick-add, then `q` (restart) | `last_action` cleared on restart; line persists. User removes manually. (Same limitation as checkbox undo — documented, not persisted.) |
| CRLF-terminated inbox | Appended line uses LF (`\n`), not CRLF — mixed endings. Parser handles it (`str::lines()` strips `\r`); Obsidian normalizes on open. Not corruption. Detecting and matching the file's dominant line ending is deferred. |
| Undo after first-creation quick-add | Line removed; inbox file remains (empty, not deleted). Harmless — next quick-add reuses it. Deleting the file would add complexity for no safety gain. |
